# IMPORTANT NOTE
The original author of this app has used yeoman generator-stui5 (which is pretty damn marvellous) to generate the initial code scaffold for the project. However, sadly, the author has not bothered to update the README file to give you, dear reader, any helpful pointers on how to extend, deploy or use the app. They are a **buffoon**. Please find them and heckle them for some basic documentation. It's just simple etiquette after all. If you are the original author and you can't remember how your app works, you only have yourself to blame. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
